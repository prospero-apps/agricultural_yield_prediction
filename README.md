Regression Models - Agricultural Yield Prediction

The purpose of this analysis is the creation and comparison of several machine learning regression models to see how good they are at predicting agricultural yield based on multiple factors.

## Contents

### 1. Data Collection
The analysis will be based on the 'Synthetic Agricultural Yield Prediction Dataset' available on kaggle.com.

This dataset consists of 16,000 records containing information on agricultural yield, such as soil quality, fertilizers, seed variety, irrigation, and weather conditions. Detailed information on each feature can be found below. All these factors may contribute to the yield. Based on these features, we'll create several machine learning models and compare their ability to correctly predict the yield on test data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
At this stage, we'll start analyzing the data only in a very general manner. Next, we'll visualize the data and examine it more closely. If necessary, we'll go through some of the steps described above again, like removing redundant rows and columns or data transformations.

### 3. Training the Models
We're going to train several traditional ML models and compare the results using some easy-to-understand metrics.
